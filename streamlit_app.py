     "why": "Messages that invoke a sense of urgency, i.e., that you have to act fast, are typically scams. Also, the first 4 digits of cards are somewhat standard and generic."},
    {"text": "You get a text that says: Thank you for your recent purchase... and then references a purchase you just made", "is_scam": False,
     "why": "The message included personal, not generic information and also didn't ask you to click on anything."},

     "why": "It may or may not be a scam. If you want a kitten, talk to your adult and then do some investigating into whether the poster is legit or a scam."},
